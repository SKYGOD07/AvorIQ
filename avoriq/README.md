# AvorIQ (Adaptive Vision for Opportunity and Resources Intelligence Quotient)

> **Your AI Learning Companion for Every Step of Student Life.**

AvorIQ is an AI-powered educational second brain designed specifically for Indian students from Class 6 to Graduation. It transforms information fragmentation and uncertainty into clear, personalized, and structured action.

## 🎯 The Problem & Our Solution

### The Problem
Millions of deserving students in India—across rural villages, government schools, and tier-2/3 cities—miss out on life-changing opportunities because:
- Scholarship and exam information is fragmented across hundreds of disorganized portals.
- Eligibility rules are dense, confusing, and difficult to comprehend.
- Critical deadlines pass by unnoticed, resulting in wasted funds and missed admissions.
- Language barriers and a lack of counseling prevent students from applying.

### Our Solution (AvorIQ)
AvorIQ aggregates, structures, and matches educational opportunities specifically to the student's unique academic and socioeconomic profile.
- **For Today (Version 1)**: A high-fidelity, client-side matching engine focused on **Scholarship Intelligence**, tracking deadlines, managing documents, and simulating AI recommendation workflows.
- **For Tomorrow (Roadmap)**: A fully integrated, vector-supported (RAG) assistant responding to voice, web, and WhatsApp queries, paired with custom learning paths and exam planners.
